# File / Text Analyzer (CLI)

A simple Python command-line program that analyzes a text file and prints the most frequent words.

The program reads a text file, converts all words to lowercase, removes punctuation, ignores empty tokens, counts how often each word appears, sorts the results by frequency, and displays the most common words.

## Usage

Run the script from the terminal:

When prompted, enter the name of a text file:

Insert filename: example.txt

Example Output
1. python - 12
2. code - 8
3. file - 5
Notes

The input file must be a plain text file.

If the file does not exist, the program prints an error message and exits.






```bash
python analyzer.py
